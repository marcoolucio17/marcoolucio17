### Hi there, I am Marco Lucio ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various software development projects, including a personal SwiftUI application that utilizes NASA's APIs to showcase captivating images of the day and search for Mars images.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new technologies and frameworks to enhance my skills as a software engineer, including machine learning techniques alongside iOS development.


ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that involve cutting-edge technologies and have a positive impact on society.


ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with exploring new opportunities and challenges in the field of computer science and software development.
